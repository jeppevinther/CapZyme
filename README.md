# CapZyme data analysis
This page contains information related to the analysis of the data in Sherwood et al, 2021. In this paper, we use the CapZyme-seq method to identify RNAs that are 5' capped with the metabolic cofactor Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD).

The CapZyme experiment compares a Control sample to a sample treated with an enzyme (AtNUDX23, Rpp or other), which specifically generate mono-phosphate at the 5’ terminal of RNAs depending on their 5' end. In combination with subsequent 5’ monophosphate specific ligation of a sequencing adaptor allows RNAs with FAD 5’ termini to be sequenced and identified by comparison to a non-treated control. In parallel, 5’ polyphosphatase (Rpp) treatment is used to allow clear differentiation between 5’ppp and FAD capped RNAs (Figure 1A).
