# CapZyme data analysis
This page contains information related to the analysis of the data in _Sherwood et al, 2021_. In this paper, we use the CapZyme-seq method to identify RNAs that are 5' capped with the metabolic cofactor Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD).

The CapZyme experiment compares a Control sample to a sample treated with an enzyme (AtNUDX23, Rpp or other), which specifically generate mono-phosphate at the 5’ terminal of RNAs depending on their 5' termini. Subsequent 5’ monophosphate specific ligation of a sequencing adaptor to RNAs allows the RNAs with a 5' modification (such as FAD) to be enriched in a sequencing experiment. This page decsribed the method used in _Sherwood et al, 2021_ to analyse the data.
